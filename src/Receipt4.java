/*
 * Modify your Receipt3.java program so that instead of randomly obtaining values 
 * for the number of drinks, candies, hot dogs, and hamburgers ordered,
 * it prompts the user to enter those values and then calculates the cost of the purchase 
 * based on the inputted values.  
 * 
 * Also ask the user to enter the full high school name. Once that is entered, 
 * have your code create initials for the high school based on the first letters of its name. 
 * For example, if the user entered “Packer High School”, your program would create 
 * the initials “PHS” and use that value for the high school name on the receipt. 
 * Use the appropriate String methods on the Java Quick Reference sheet to create the 
 * high school initials. 
 * 
 * For consistency, you may expect the user to enter a three-word name for the high school 
 * (e.g., “Isidore Newman School” instead of “Newman School”)
